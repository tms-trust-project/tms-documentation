Architecture
###########################

Terminology
===========

To understand the TMS architecture it is useful to establish definitions for the various
components comprising TMS as well as the external components with which TMS will interact:

*Science Gateway*
  A project that uses TMS for trust management and an application client, such as Tapis, for
  operations on resources at a resource provider.
*Application Client*
  An application, such as a Tapis, that will make use of TMS for credential management.
*Application Client User*
  A person who performs a login to the application client through a federated identity broker
  connected to their institution. Typically initiated by a science gateway.
*Federated Identity Broker*
  Service supporting federated login, e.g., *Globus* or *CILogon*. This is the service the application
  client is configured to use to allow users to login through their institution.
*Resource Provider (RP)*
  A cyber-infrastructure provider supporting OAuth login and providing one or more resource hosts.
  Examples of such providers are TACC, SDSC, NCSA, Purdue and PSC.
*Resource Provider OAuth Server (RPOS)*
  An OAuth server for a resource provider.
*Resource Provider Resource Server (RPRS)*
  A REST API service available at a resource provider allowing for the retrieval of resource
  metadata associated with a user account.
*Resource*
  The host provided by a resource provider, such as *stampede3@tacc*, *expanse@sdsc*.
*TMS Portal*
  The TMS web UI and back-end REST API server supporting the RP linking and resource delegation
  initiated by the gateway. Provides OAuth login support to Tapis and the gateway.
*TMS Credential Server*
  The TMS back-end REST API server supporting SSH key-pair generation and SSH public key lookup.
*TMS Host Module*
  A TMS program on the resource host that is executed when a resource account user attempts to
  login to the host using SSH. The program is also referred to as TMS KeyCmd.

TMS Components

External Components
-------------------


.. .. Minimal Viable Product
.. .. ======================

.. .. .. figure:: TMSArchitecture-MVP.drawio.png
.. ..    :align: center

.. ..    **Figure 1 - TMS MVP Architecture**

.. Figure 1 shows the basic TMS architecture.

.. .. The MVP release is restricted in these ways:

.. ..    - Keys do not automatically expire or have a limited number of uses.
.. ..    - TMS does not automate MFA challenge/response.
.. ..    - User identities are the same as their login account name on all systems.
.. ..    - Only well-known client applications are allowed to use TMS.

.. The server supports an SSH key pair generator and an external database to persist application, user and host data. All server functions are delivered through REST interfaces. The server is written in Rust with well-defined internal interfaces that allow new authentication methods to be incorporated in a standardized way.

.. Hosts that support TMS-generated SSH keys will need their SSHD to be configured with the *KeyCmd* program to dynamically retrieve public keys from the TMS Server.  In :ref:`key_management_label`, we show how applications create SSH key pairs and use TMS as an on-demand, key escrow for public keys, which avoids the need to distribute those keys to hosts in advance.


.. .. Possible Future Extensions
.. .. ==========================

.. .. .. figure:: TMSArchitecture2-FULL.drawio.png
.. ..    :align: center

.. ..    **Figure 2 - TMS Full Architecture**

.. .. Figure 2 shows the full TMS architecture diagram with a TMS Server configured with a Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) authenticator that allows applications to programmatically satisfy MFA challenges; a SSH key pair generator; a token generator; and experimental WebAuthn support. 

.. .. In addition to the capabilities discussed for the MVP version, the full architecture has these capabilities:

.. ..    - Automated MFA login for a configurable time period.
.. ..    - Keys with limited lifetimes and number of uses.
.. ..    - Federated IDP support.
.. ..    - A protocol that challenges users to authenticate on a host before their identity can be linked to that host and delegated to a client application.
.. ..    - Experimental credentials support, such as token login (such as SciTokens) and WebAuthn integration.
.. ..    - An optional non-SSH, agent-based communication channel between client applications and hosts.   

.. .. TMS is not itself an Identity Provider (IDP), but instead interacts with existing federated (e.g., InCommon) and institution-specific IDPs. Highlighted in bright dashed boxes are placeholders for experimental features such as JWT authentication (e.g., SciTokens), WebAuthn support or communication via an Agent installed on the host.

.. .. The command line program **tmsctl** is deployed on target host systems and is used to communicate with the TMS server during certain OAuth2 style flows. Associated with tmsctl is the **TMS Host Signer** daemon that provides a secure way to (1) identify the user account and host running tmsctl and (2) guarantee the integrity of data transmitted from tmsctl to the TMS server. 

.. .. Hosts that support generated SSH keys will need SSHD to be configured with the TMS Key Cmd program to dynamically retrieve public keys escrowed on the TMS Server. Hosts that support token login will need a custom PAM module installed to parse and validate tokens. This PAM module may be adapted from an existing implementation, such as SciTokens, or may be built from scratch. Hosts that support non-SSH based application authentication will need the TMS Agent installed.

.. Creating TMS Keys
.. =================

.. The following figure describes how TMS MVP is used by client web applications to create SSH key pairs.

.. .. figure:: TMSSshKeyCreate.drawio.png
..    :align: center

..    **Figure 3 - TMS Key Creation**

.. Step 1
.. ------
.. An authenticated user issues a CreateUserCredential REST call to the Client Web Appl to generate a key pair for a host machine (not shown) that they are authorized to use.

.. Step 2
.. ------
.. The Client Web App issues a */tms/pubkeys/creds* REST call to the TMS Server (TMSS) to create a new SSH key pair.  TMSS will only honor the request if these conditions hold:

..    1. The client application is registered in a TMS tenant and presents its TMS generated client-id and client-secret to TMSS.  
..    2. The user on behalf of whom the request is being made has a valid, unexpired MFA in effect.
..    3. The user has previously linked their user identity to an account on the host machine.
..    4. The user has previously delegated authority to the client application to act on their behalf on that host.

.. Only if all of these checks pass will TMSS generate a key pair.  Supported key types are RSA (4096 bits), ECDSA (521 bits) and ED25519 (256 bits); ED25519 being the default.  The client can also specify the number of uses and expiration time of the keys.  TMSS will put the new public key in its database, along with a fingerprint of the public key, and pass the private key back to the client.  

.. *Note that in the MVP release (1) all keys have unlimited uses and don’t expire, (2) user MFAs are implicit and never expire, (3) a user’s identity is always the same as their host account name, and (4) users implicitly delegate the Client Web Application to act on their behalf. As such, the TMS MVP can only be run in a tightly controlled environment.*

.. Step 3
.. ------
.. The Client Web App writes the private key to its secure Key Store.  An important characteristic of this flow is that the portal user–or any end user for that matter–never sees or has access to the private key generated by TMS and used by the client application to login to the user's host account.


.. Using TMS Keys
.. ==============

.. The following figure describes how TMS MVP is used by client web applications to use SSH key pairs previously created.

.. .. figure:: TMSSshKeyUse.drawio.png
..    :align: center

..    **Figure 4 - TMS Key Usage**

.. Step 1
.. ------
.. An authenticated user issues a *submitJob* request to the Client Web App to run a batch job on Host A.

.. Step 2
.. ------
.. The Client Web App retrieves the user's private key from the secure Key Store.

.. Step 3
.. ------
.. The Client Web App initiates an SSH connection to the user’s account on Host A using the private key.

.. Step 4
.. ------
.. The TMS KeyCmd module previously installed and configured on the Host A is called by SSHD to provide a public key.  KeyCmd makes the */tms/pubkeys/creds/retrieve* REST call to TMSS to retrieve the user’s public key.  The call’s parameters include the target host, account name and public key fingerprint.

.. TMSS uses the call parameters to match the unique public key in its database if one exists.  If found, TMSS will return the public key only if:

..    1. The client application matches the client that originally created the key pair.
..    2. The user on behalf of whom the client is executing has a valid, unexpired MFA in effect.
..    3. The user has previously linked their identity to the host account on the host machine.
..    4. The user has previously delegated authority to the client application to act on their behalf.

.. As discussed in the previous flow, most of these checks will always succeed because of the limited function TMS version deployed for the MVP release.

.. Step 5
.. ------
.. Upon successful retrieval of the public key by KeyCmd, SSHD establishes a login session with the Client Web App, which is then free to issue commands on the target host on behalf of the end user.  In this example, the client application submits a batch job on Host A.

.. APIs
.. #############

.. TMS implements CRUD APIs on each of the resources it manages:

..    1. **clients** - Client applications that are authorized to request key pair creation.
..    2. **delegations** - Authority granted by users to allow clients to act on their behalf on specific hosts.
..    3. **hosts** - Hosts on which client applications may be granted access.
..    4. **pubkeys** - The public key of a key pair generated 
..    5. **reservations** - Allow long running, cross-microservice operation to continue past MFA or key expiration.  
..    6. **tenants** - Multi-tenancy support.
..    7. **user_hosts** - Map user identities to host accounts.
..    8. **user_mfa** - Track MFA expiration times for users.

.. Two endpoints that are not associated with specific resources can be used to test connectivity to the server.  Here are curl commands that work in TACC's development environment, adjust the host addresses for your installation::

..    | curl https://tms-server-dev.tacc.utexas.edu:3000/v1/tms/version
..    | curl https://tms-server-dev.tacc.utexas.edu:3000/v1/tms/hello
